Week 18 Social Network API

This week we were asked to make an api for the backend of a social media site. This allowed for the functionality to create, update, and delete users and thoughts as well as getting all or a single user and thought. There was routes set up to add or remove a friend as well as add or remove a reaction from a thought. This was done using express and mongoose. Each element was set up using models and then was exported to the routes using the controllers.
